# 2-to-1-Multiplexer-using-Logic-Gates-in-Proteus-ISIS
Proteus circuit of 2-to-1 Multiplexer using Logic Gates.
This is the project in which only simple basic Logic Gates are used to design a 2-into-1 Multiplexer. The Multiplexer has the functionality to show the output on the bases of one selective input (out of three inputs). Two AND, one NOT and one OR gate is used in the circuit. This project have four conditions of the 2-into-1 MUX that are enough to design a truth table.Check www.theengineeringprojects.com for such amazing projects.
